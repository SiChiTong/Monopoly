# Monopoly Project
This was the final project for my CSCI103 class (Introduction to Programming). Everything was created from scratch using Photoshop and C++. It allows up to 4 players to play together on the same computer together and functions much like the original Monopoly game. The Game Board and cards are customized but the game pieces are pulled from the real versions of Monopoly.
